# BoonwinsBattlegroundsTracker
A HDT Plugin to track your ranks and mmr change of the day and show it on stream.

This is still a Beta, I'll add all this later.

You have to Install this as any other HDT Plugin.
Go into HDT, click options, go to plugin, then click on open plugin folder.
Unzip and copy the whole folder into the Plugin-folder of HDT, not just the ini files.
